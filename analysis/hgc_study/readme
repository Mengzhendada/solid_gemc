Here is the files and scripts to run simulation and analysis results

It can work as standalone, but also test with other subsystems and full SoLID simulation

== run == 

#run simulation standalone in gui mode
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_hgc.gcard
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_hgc_moved.gcard

#run simulation standalone in batch mode
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_He3_hgc_batch.gcard -BEAM_P="pi-,5*GeV,10*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -OUTPUT=evio,output.evio -N=1e3 -NO_FIELD="all"
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_NH3_hgc_batch.gcard -BEAM_P="pi-,5*GeV,10*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -OUTPUT=evio,output.evio -N=1e3 -NO_FIELD="all"
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_He3_hgc_moved_batch.gcard -BEAM_P="pi-,5*GeV,10*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -OUTPUT=evio,output.evio -N=1e3
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_NH3_hgc_moved_batch.gcard -BEAM_P="pi-,5*GeV,10*deg,0*deg" -BEAM_V="(0,0,-350)cm" -OUTPUT=evio,output.evio -N=1e3

#convert evio file in standalone simulation to root file
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="../hgc_solid_gemc/solid_SIDIS_hgc"
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="../hgc_moved_solid_gemc/solid_SIDIS_hgc"

#run simulation with other subsystems
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_He3_full.gcard
solid_gemc solid_SIDIS_NH3_full.gcard

#convert evio file in full simulation to root file
evio2root -INPUTF=output.evio -B="../ec_solid_gemc/solid_SIDIS_ec_forwardangle ../ec_solid_gemc/solid_SIDIS_ec_largeangle ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/hgc/solid_SIDIS_hgc ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/lgc/solid_SIDIS_lgc ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/hgc/solid_SIDIS_hgc ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/gem/solid_SIDIS_gem ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/mrpc/solid_SIDIS_mrpc_forwardangle ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/spd/solid_SIDIS_spd_forwardangle ../../../solid_gemc2/geometry/spd/solid_SIDIS_spd_largeangle"

use run option -NO_FIELD="all" to turn off all field temporally.

== analysis == 

root> .x analysis.C+("output.root")

== run and analysis ==

do  "mkdir output" first

run and run_all are example scripts to produce many root files

getplot are example scripts to run analysis.C on files output by the run scripts

remember to "mv output output_test" and "mkdir output" again to separate files by different dir when running different tests

about background events
File "/cache/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_1.3/pass8/farm_solid_SIDIS_He3_moved_BeamOnTarget_0.561e10_skim_HGCwinCF1.root"
SoLID SIDIS He3 run use 15uA beam, so there 15e-6/1.6e-19*50e-9=4.7e6 e- within 50ns time window
this skim file has 0.561e10 beam e-. It is 0.561e10/4.7e6=1194 of 50ns time window
This file has 3990487 not-empty-anydetector events and ~9000 not-empty-hgc event. So each 50ns time window, there are 9000/1194=7.5 events in hgc

good hgc event ~9000
9000/1194=7.5
7.5/30=0.25

/volatile/halla/solid/sim/solid_gemc/SIDIS_He3_JLAB_VERSION_2.5/pass1/solid_SIDIS_He3_moved_full_BeamOnTarget_4.8e9_filter_output.root 
good hgc event ~7500 

===========================================================

see two files at
/work/halla/solid/zwzhao/solid/output_hgc_study/JLAB_VERSION_1.3/hgc_moved/tmp/
the matrix.ml file is the big matrix
the other file is in old style with matching Npe to matrix file
Let me know if you can use the matrix file and I can make more then.

The code to produce ml files are at
https://github.com/JeffersonLab/solid_gemc/tree/master/analysis/ml
see readme

I made two files for you to try at
/work/halla/solid/zwzhao/solid/output_hgc_study/JLAB_VERSION_1.3/hgc_moved/test
in ml file, the line "gen pid_gen  px_gen  py_gen   pz_gen   vx_gen vy_gen   vz_gen"
pid for pim and km
mom are in MeV and vertex are in mm
You can use mom and angle range I used in preCDR hgc plots
